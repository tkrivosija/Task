Everything that was required in the task was done. The data was read from Github using a 
function getJSON from the jQuery library. In the same function, code is written that displays data on the front end of the page. 
After that, a GitHub model of user is created in order to write the data in JSON format locally. This is done using C# and ASP.NET controls. 
Before you write the data u must make folder on path : C:\Users\User\Desktop\json.
Finally the authentication is done using the javascript function, where after the user enters his personal access token from GitHub and his username, he can see which 
private repositories his profile contains which cannot be seen without authentication. I would note that I used only basic styling 
and basic validation of the entered data. The task was done in Visual Studio 2019 and to check if it is working properly, you need to run a file called WebForm1.aspx. 
Before that remember to enter your own personal access token from GitHub as well as your GitHub username where indicated in order to check bonus requirements. 
If you can't run the file check attributes "CodeBehind" and "Inherits" on the top of the WebForm1.aspx page.
